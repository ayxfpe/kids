## Today's Teaching Diary

1. Angela did not join the class today.

2. Taught Alex how to write a game specification:

   a. Used the checker game as an example.
   b. Utilized prompts and asked AI to write a game project description.
   c. Examined the description, adding and removing specifications as needed.
   d. Added the description to a composer to generate the game as specified.
   e. Identified easy code bugs (direct error output) and fixed them with the composer.
   f. Identified logic bugs and fixed them by editing the description and passing it back to the composer.
   g. Verified that the game works as intended.

3. The entire process took approximately 30 minutes with Alex's focused attention.

### Reflections

The creation of the checker game with Alex today was a significant achievement. Here are some key reflections:

1. Efficiency: Completing a complex game like checkers in just 30 minutes is impressive. This demonstrates Alex's growing proficiency in using AI tools and understanding game development concepts.

2. Satisfaction: Alex seemed quite pleased with the outcome, which is excellent for maintaining motivation and interest in programming.

3. Hands-on Learning: Alex's tendency to experiment independently during class is a double-edged sword:
   - Positives: It shows initiative, curiosity, and a desire to learn through practical application.
   - Concerns: This approach may lead to missing important foundational concepts or efficient methods taught in class.

4. Balance is Key: While self-directed learning is valuable in the long term, it's crucial to strike a balance with structured learning, especially for mastering fundamentals.

5. Classroom Behavior: This tendency to work independently during lessons might extend to regular school classes. It's important to remind Alex that active listening in class can provide new insights and prevent unnecessary struggles.

6. Guided Exploration: To harness Alex's enthusiasm while ensuring comprehensive learning, we should:
   - Encourage questions about concepts he explores independently.
   - Provide structured time for free exploration after covering essential topics.
   - Discuss the benefits of following along with instruction before diving into individual projects.

7. Future Focus: In upcoming sessions, we should emphasize the importance of building a strong foundation while still nurturing Alex's creative and exploratory spirit.

Moving forward, I'll aim to create more interactive lessons that cater to Alex's hands-on learning style while ensuring all crucial concepts are covered. Additionally, I'll spend some time playing the checker game with Alex to better understand his thought process and coding approach.


### Next Class Plan

- Introduce AI-assisted diary writing techniques to streamline the documentation process.
- Explore the file structure and Python coding of a simple game, such as texas_trivia:
  a. Analyze the main game file and its components.
  b. Examine how game logic is implemented in Python.
  c. Discuss the organization of assets (e.g., questions and answers).
  d. Review any utility functions or helper modules used in the game.
