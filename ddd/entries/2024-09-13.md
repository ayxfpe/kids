## Today's Teaching Diary

1. Angela did not join the class today.

2. Taught Alex how to write a game specification:

   a. Used the checker game as an example.
   b. Utilized prompts and asked AI to write a game project description.
   c. Examined the description, adding and removing specifications as needed.
   d. Added the description to a composer to generate the game as specified.
   e. Identified easy code bugs (direct error output) and fixed them with the composer.
   f. Identified logic bugs and fixed them by editing the description and passing it back to the composer.
   g. Verified that the game works as intended.

3. The entire process took approximately 30 minutes with Alex's focused attention.

### Reflections

- This hands-on approach seemed effective in teaching game development concepts.
- Alex showed good engagement with the process, especially in identifying and fixing bugs.
- The use of AI tools in the teaching process proved to be time-efficient and practical.

### Next Steps

- Follow up with Angela to ensure she's caught up on today's lesson.
- Consider expanding on this method for future lessons, perhaps with different types of games.
- Assess Alex's understanding in the next class and provide any necessary reinforcement.
