# AI-Assisted Diary Project

## Project Objective
Develop an AI-assisted diary system using markdown files, providing an organized and intelligent way to manage personal entries.

## Project Framework
- Markdown files for content storage
- Python for backend processing
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated parsing and tagging

## Project Structure
1. Homepage (index.md)
2. Individual teaching diary entries (lcx-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
3. Individual student diary entries (ayx-YYYY-MM-DD.md) and (azx-YYYY-MM-DD.md)
3. Python scripts for file management and AI processing
4. a concept tree file that mimic the tech tree of the polytopia game, easily editable to include or exclude new concepts based on teaching progress.
5. a concept tree figure that renders the concept tree file as the tech tree of the polytopia game, with the current teaching progress.

## Homepage Layout
The homepage (index.md) will consist of the following sections:
1. Sticky Diaries: Important or frequently accessed entries
2. Chronicle Diaries: Recent entries listed chronologically
3. Teaching Progress: The rendered concept tree figure, with the current teaching progress (blue taught, green untaught).
4. Search Window: Interface for searching diary contents

## Core Features
1. Automated Entry Processing
2. Intelligent Tagging
3. Smart Search
4. Sticky Entries
5. Chronological View

## User Interaction
1. Creating an Entry
2. Viewing Entries
3. Searching

## Technical Implementation
1. File Monitoring
2. AI Processing

4. Search Functionality

## Future Enhancements
1. Web interface for easier interaction and mobile accessibility
2. Data visualization of diary trends and sentiments over time
3. Integration with external APIs for weather, location, or activity data
4. Customizable AI models for personalized content analysis and tagging
