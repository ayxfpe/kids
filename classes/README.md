# Cursor

Cursor is an AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built as a fork of Visual Studio Code. It combines the familiar interface of VS Code with advanced AI capabilities to enhance the coding experience.

## Key Features

- AI-assisted code completion and generation
- Natural language code explanations
- Intelligent code refactoring suggestions
- Seamless integration with popular programming languages and frameworks

## Getting Started

# Composer Mode

Composer Mode is a powerful feature in Cursor that allows developers to interact with AI using natural language to generate, modify, and refactor code. It is very powerful and can be used to generate entire classes or functions for multiple files. It provides an intuitive interface for leveraging AI assistance in your development workflow. You can accpet all changes at once by clicking the "Accept All" button.

## Key Features of Composer Mode

- Natural language code generation
- AI-assisted code editing and refactoring
- Context-aware suggestions and explanations
- Seamless integration with your existing codebase

## Getting Started with Composer Mode

To access Composer Mode in Cursor, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux), or click on the Composer icon in the sidebar.

## Required Prerequisites for Learning Cursor and Composer

To effectively learn and use Cursor and its Composer Mode, students should have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Computer Skills:
   - Familiarity with operating a computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
   - Understanding of file systems and basic navigation

2. Fundamental Programming Concepts:
   - Basic understanding of what programming is and its purpose
   - Familiarity with the concept of writing instructions for computers

3. Text Editing:
   - Experience with basic text editors or simple code editors
   - Understanding of typing and editing text

4. Command Line Basics:
   - Basic knowledge of using command-line interfaces (CLI)
   - Familiarity with running simple commands

5. Version Control and Git:
   - Basic understanding of version control systems (e.g., Git)
   - Familiarity with the concept of code repositories
   - Basic knowledge of Git commands (e.g., clone, commit, push, pull)
   - Understanding of GitHub's interface and features (e.g., repositories, pull requests)

6. Web Browsing:
   - Ability to navigate websites and use web-based applications
   - Understanding of how to download and install software

7. English Language:
   - Basic proficiency in reading and writing English, as Cursor's AI primarily communicates in English

8. Logical Thinking:
   - Basic problem-solving skills
   - Ability to break down tasks into smaller steps

9. Curiosity and Willingness to Learn:
   - Open-mindedness towards AI-assisted coding
   - Enthusiasm for exploring new technologies

Note: There is no specific age limitation for learning Cursor and Composer. However, users should have the cognitive ability to understand and apply the prerequisites listed above. Generally, this tool might be more suitable for teenagers and adults, but precocious younger learners with a strong interest in programming could also benefit from it under proper guidance.


##  issues of Cursor Composer Known to me 

1. apply doest not occur after the click (likely happening if same error occurs twice even after accept all)

> Q: is last changes applied?
>
> Yes, the last changes have been applied. Here's a summary of the key modifications:
>
> - In ezm/maze.py:
>   - The `generate` method was updated to use the correct function name for the recursive division algorithm.

2. forget user instructed external files (forget some functions are already defined in external file and try to rewrite) 

> Q: Those functions are already in @maze.py

> A: I apologize for the confusion. You're right that the maze generation functions are already implemented in maze.py. Let's focus on resolving the issue with the recursive division algorithm not being found. The problem seems to be in how the algorithm name is being handled between ezm.py and maze.py.

3. need to drag the window by middle bar

> Q: keep contents in mazeai readonly

> A: I apologize for the confusion. You're right that we should keep the contents of the mazeai directory readonly. Let's focus on resolving the issue without modifying the existing JavaScript files.
> The problem seems to be that the recursive division algorithm is causing a stack overflow error. Since we can't modify the JavaScript file, we'll need to handle this in the Python code. Here's what we can do:
> In the maze.py file, let's add a fallback  


4. Cursor Composer Shortcuts and Keymapping Issues

I found Cursor Composer's shortcuts and keymapping can sometimes be unintuitive or unresponsive.

5. Not working well with Vim mode

6. After a while, Cursor Composer may stop working and will need to be restarted, or occasionally crashes the Cursor IDE.

6. Undesired overwriting of files, wish a way to specify which files are immune to changes. 

7. AI coding not working well with designing complex game controls. handling dependencies of all types of states change are still immature.

## Other Known problems of the tools

1. Memory limit errors: Composer may fail with a "PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size exhausted" message. This can be resolved by increasing the PHP memory limit [1][2].

2. Package not found errors: This can occur due to typos in composer.json, incorrect minimum-stability settings, or network/firewall issues [2].

3. Operation timeout errors: These are often related to IPv6 configuration issues. Workarounds include forcing IPv4 resolution or disabling IPv6 [2].

4. SSH ControlMaster hanging: Composer may hang indefinitely when using SSH ControlMaster. A workaround is to open an SSH connection to the Git host before running Composer [2].

5. Zip archive unpacking issues: On some operating systems, Composer may have trouble unpacking zip archives correctly, especially with permissions and symlinks [2].

6. Pool optimizer issues: In rare cases, the pool optimizer may cause unexpected results in dependency resolution. This can be diagnosed by disabling the optimizer [2].

7. Application execution issues: Some users have reported that applications may not execute properly if the Composer window is too full. However, this claim requires further verification as it's not mentioned in the official documentation.
