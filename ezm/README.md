- Leaderboard system

## Similar Games

EscapeZombieMazia shares similarities with various maze and dungeon-crawling games:

1. Pac-Man: While not exactly the same, it involves navigating a maze while avoiding enemies.

2. Maze Runner games: These often involve solving a maze with various obstacles or enemies.

3. Dungeon crawlers: Many roguelike games feature maze-like levels with enemies and items to collect.

4. Educational maze games: Used to teach problem-solving skills, often with simpler graphics.

5. 3D maze games: More immersive versions that put the player in a first-person perspective.

6. Procedurally generated maze games: Similar to this implementation, where mazes are created algorithmically.

7. Multiplayer maze games: Where players compete to solve mazes or catch each other.

EscapeZombieMazia combines elements from several of these, such as:
- Procedural maze generation
- Enemy avoidance (zombies)
- Item collection (sword)
- Multiple algorithms for maze creation

This combination makes the game unique while still being familiar to players who enjoy maze-based challenges. The addition of different maze generation algorithms as a selectable feature is particularly interesting and educational.
