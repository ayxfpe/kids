Project Objective:
    Develop a classic 2048 game using Pygame

Game Framework:
    - Pygame
    - No external images or sounds, or assets
    - Only implementing the game according to this description
    - No animations or sound effects

Game Layout:
    - Game board: 4x4 grid
    - Tile display: Colored tiles with numbers
    - Score display: Shows current score
    - Best score display: Shows best score achieved
    - Game status: Shows game state (e.g., "In Progress", "Game Over")

Game Rules:
    1. The game is played on a 4x4 grid
    2. The game starts with two tiles, each displaying either 2 or 4
    3. Players can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right
    4. When moved, tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction
    5. If two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values
    6. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in an empty spot on the board
    7. The game ends when there are no more possible moves (grid is full and no merges are possible)
    8. The objective is to create a tile with the number 2048

Game Controls:
    - Arrow keys to move tiles (up, down, left, right)
    - Button to restart the game at any time

Game Features:
    - Implement move validation to ensure only legal moves are allowed
    - Automatic merging of tiles with the same value
    - Random generation of new tiles (2 or 4) after each move
    - Score calculation based on merged tile values
    - Game over detection when no more moves are possible
    - Best score tracking across multiple games

User Interface:
    - Clear, visually appealing board and tile design
    - Color scheme for different tile values
    - Display of current score and best score
    - Game over screen with final score and option to restart
    - Quit button to exit the game

Additional Features (for future updates):
    - Undo move functionality
    - Different board sizes (e.g., 5x5, 6x6)
    - Animations for tile movements and merges
    - Sound effects for moves and merges
    - Time attack mode
    - Leaderboard for high scores
